# libestg3b

ยง 3b of the german Einkommensteuergesetz (EStG) defines the premiums for work on
weekends, holidays and special days, like new year. This library takes a list of
work hours / shifts (e.g. on 2018-06-03 from 19:00 until 03:00) and returns the
premium factor (e.g. 1.5) as well as the relevant timespans.
